## Airee - Wireless Air Quality monitor
I´ve had the GP2Y1010AU0F air quality sensor laying in my parts bin for a little over 2 years now and haven´t yet utilised it. This is my attempt at a pcb for it, using a WeMos D1 mini in order to make the data accessible wirelessly, and 5 LEDs for quickly checking the current air quality. I have yet to implement the code, will rectify in the future.
